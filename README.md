This repository contains the data and scripts used in the manuscript:

**A method to assess inter- and intra- vessel shape variation in pottery using outline-based geometric morphometrics (GMM)**

The repository is organised into three main directories: Data, Figures, Scripts, and Supplementary Materials

The Data folder contains all original data files as tps and csv files, the Scripts directory contains R scripts and any non-figure outputs, Figures contains all figures in the manuscript (those generated from the R scripts and other figures presented), and the supplementary materials contains documents and figures referenced as such throughout the text.

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 101021480, granted to Marcos Martinón-Torres).
