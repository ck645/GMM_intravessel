This repository contains the data and scripts used in the manuscript:

**New method to assess inter- and intra- shape variation of ceramic vessels using GMM**

The repository is organised into three directories: Figures, Scripts, and Supplementary Materials

The Scripts directory contains R scripts for all of the analysis as well as the data (as tps and csv files), Figures contains all figures in the manuscript (those generated from the R scripts and other figures presented), and the supplementary materials contains documents and figures referenced as such throughout the text.
